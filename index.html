      <h2>The Ethics Behind a Bridge</h2>
      <p>The Bay Bridge originally began as an idea during California's early history; as early as the days of the Gold Rush, Californians had begun advocating for a way to connect San Francisco and Oakland. In 1933, construction of this idea finally began. After only three years from the start of construction, on November 12, 1936, the bridge opened for use, finally connecting the two cities. This project presented itself as a great success: it finished quickly, it fully accomplished its goal of connecting the cities, and it came under budget. The first major repair of the bridge happened following the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake; major damage was done to the eastern crossing between Yerba Buena and Oakland, pushing the state of California to build a whole new span of the bridge. This repair came about successfully and was completed in a month. However, as further repairs became necessary, this history of success came crumbling down. In 2002, various issues across the bridge forced repairs to be done. This project was a complete disaster: retrofitting for earthquakes was not entirely successful, the project took over a decade, it went over budget, and it did not accomplish as much as it could have.</p>
      <p>In 1992, CalTrans originally estimated rebuilding and repairing the Bay Bridge would cost 250 million dollars; in 1996, this figure had already climbed to 1.6 billion dollars. The huge jump in cost from the original estimate came about because politicians believed it would be more cost efficient to replace the entire span instead of retrofitting it. This idea was then approved by the panel responsible for the project in 1996, and by 1997 Governor Wilson announced that the east span of the bridge would be replaced. The original design was to move forward with a viaduct unadorned by a tower. However, backlash ensued as many people felt the bridge needed to be nicer and more elegant, leading to a design change to a single tower suspension bridge. This design change came with another spike in price, hiking CalTrans' estimate to 2.6 billion dollars by 2001. Even this figure would not be enough as the cost was once again revised to 5 billion dollars by 2005. The main cause of the ever-increasing cost: the tower. It was manufactured in China in order to save money but once inspectors had a look, they found inadequate welding and busted bolts at crucial locations that needed to be replaced, leading to greater costs than what they had intended to save. By the time the east span was completed, the estimated cost came out to be 6.5 billion dollars. The main issue came directly from poor cost management. The California government was tasked to fulfill the ethical obligation of maintaining crucial infrastructure but failed to do so  in a manner that truly helped its residents. By failing to not only not stay within budget, but completely lacking transparency as to why costs kept rising, the California government failed to meet its ethical obligations of serving the people and serving them in an efficient manner, both time and money wise.</p>
      <p>Beyond engineering problems, poor management was a critical source of problems in the project. The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) in a retrospective report published in 2014 found that in addition to engineering and transparency issues, some of the longest delays “were the product of political infighting at the very highest levels of California state government.” This infighting was driven by the conflicting motives of different parties in the project team. Some engineers and managers sought to ensure the safety and integrity of the bridge. Others, particularly the management, felt pressure to deliver the project on time, and decided that fast-tracking construction was more important than addressing concerns brought up by engineers or communicating with the public. When one engineer raised the issue of the high rate of cracked welds being produced by one of their subcontractors, the response from management was to “not find cracks.” When another engineer suggested scanning the bridge tower welds for cracks, he was told by management that he “complained too much,” and was swiftly reassigned. The MTC report claims that this pattern of “gagging and banishing” repeated itself with at least nine experts who voiced concerns about the project, either by ending their contracts or assigning them to other roles. These allegations of engineers being punished by management give the appearance of a cover-up on a project which had already drawn the public eye during a 2005 FBI probe on a suspected conspiracy by bridge management to cover up faulty welds. Despite both the FBI probe and the MTC report concluding that the welds are ultimately safe enough, the failure to resolve infighting and communicate these challenges to the public deals a major blow to public trust.

        There was also much left to be desired from the bridge. A widely discussed topic of ethical discourse that reemerged from the 2013 reopening of the Eastern span of the bridge surrounded widespread concerns over a lack of a bike lane or pedestrian path along the Western span of the bridge, that would connect Yerba Buena Island with San Francisco. Many saw the lack of a bike path across the entire Bay Bridge as something unreflective of the Bay Area, which is generally seen as an alternative transportation and pedestrian-positive place. Popular ethical arguments surrounding this topic claim that it is unfair to the general population that there is no human (pedestrian)-centric option for travel across the entire bridge, especially now that comparisons can be drawn from the bike lane on the newly opened Eastern span of the bridge. This issue has sparked widespread response, advocacy, and protest in support of creation of a bike lane on the Western span. In September of 2023, Bike East Bay's Robert Prinz hosted a 44-mile bike ride called “Transbay the Hard Way,” in which a group of bikers rode from downtown San Francisco all the way around the Bay, crossing both the Golden Gate and Richmond-San Rafael bridges, to eventually end up on Yerba Buena Island. While being a celebration for the 10-year anniversary of the Bay Bridge's Eastern span opening a bike and pedestrian lane to Yerba Buena, it also strategically highlighted the incompleteness of a full route across the bridge to connect Oakland to San Francisco directly . Additionally, there have been multiple biker takeovers of the bridge, blocking traffic in protest of the lack of the Western bike path. As a government, California has an ethical obligation to fulfill, this time to ensure the cleanliness of its environment and security of the future of the country. If projects that are being built with the knowledge of just how harmful climate change has been and will be in the future and they do nothing to address it, it is safe to say the California state government has failed to meet its obligations it has to its citizens.

        The Bay Bridge: what was seen as a great success and step towards the economic rise of the Bay Area almost a century ago has now become a symbol of how politicians continue to fail to fulfill their obligations to their citizens. With the immense cost, time, and effort of the 2013 project, it should have been a great architectural achievement, something that could be looked at as a success for decades to come. Instead, just a decade later, it is quite evident that it was a disaster and a complete underachievement that ultimately just left California residents unhappy and untrusting of their own government. With similar projects happening, and taking similar courses, California residents must look at this failure and ensure that these disappointments do not once again occur, especially during an election year.
